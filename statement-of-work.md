Penetration Test - Statement of Work

**product name and version**

_TODO: update all text in bold. Text in italics, like this, give hints to document authors and needs to be removed_

# Introduction

##	Goal
The objective of this penetration test is to uncover vulnerabilities in the assets of the system being examined, aiming to enhance the system's overall information security. Furthermore, this penetration test is mandatory to demonstrate compliance to internal and external secure software development life-cycle procedures. A comprehensive penetration test report will provide in-depth information on all discoveries, while a summarized report will present a condensed version suitable for sharing with third parties. In addition, the penetration test shall also be an opportunity for the client to learn more about security testing and which activities can be executed by the client in the future.

##	Approach
This statement-of-work document contains all information towards a potential penetration testing provider including 
1. documentation about the system under test
1. requirements towards the vendor and the penetration testers / ethical hackers
1. definitions of the target of the penetration test
1. the minimum activities required in the execution of the penetration test
1. requirements for the reporting of the penetration test
1. run-down and post-test activities  

#	System under test
The following documentation is provided as annex to this statement of work document
1. end-user documentation - including configuration, operating environment requirements, users and roles, use cases
1. internal documentation - for example a "new developer quickstart guide" or anything to get pentesters started 
1. list of assets - including asset impact matrix by impediment
1. system architecture - including interfaces, data-flow diagrams, network protocols, SBOM
1. security assessment - threat model, cybersecurity risk management analysis

_TODO:Provide the above information with this SoW. If not available in existing documents or in case you do not want to share the entire document, add it as sub-chapter here, see example below_

## Asset impact matrix
The following matrix highlights protection requirements from a business perspective for each asset per impediment (confidentiality, integrity and availability):

| Asset                        | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Patient Health Information   | high            | high      | medium       |
| License information          | high            | medium    | medium       |
| Log files                    | none            | low       | low          |
| Intended Use (functionality) | n/a             | n/a       | critical     |

__TODO: Update that list to match the assets, change C/I/A values according to your business needs__

#	Provider Requirements

The following chapters describe requirements for the penetration testing provider, and its members of staff that directly participate in the penetration test of the system under test.

## Organization

The penetration testing provider must have proven experience in conducting penetration tests in the industry.

The penetration testing provider and all of the penetration testers must not be involved in any activities related to the development or maintenance of the system under test other than penetration testing. 

The penetration testing provider agrees that the intellectual ownership of all documents created for this penetration test, including but not limited to the pentest report, is transferred to the client. The client may use these documents at their own discretion, including (but not limited to) sharing the documentation with regulatory authorities, customers, or providers for future penetration tests.

The penetration testing background of the organization as well as their independance must be documented in the report.

## Pentest Methodology

The penetration test must follow best practice from at least one of the major frameworks, such as  

* Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) 
* Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) 
* NIST Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (SP 800-115) 
* Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) 
* OWASP (Web / Mobile / Firmware) Testing Guide 
* BSI Praxis-Leitfaden für IS-Penetrationstests

The methodology of choice must fit the system under test and can be tailored. 

The pentest report must document, which methodology has been chosen by the pentest provider and why. The reporting structure should reflect the activities in the methodology as further evidence of its adherence.

## Penetration Testers

The penetration test project members responsible for executing the actual testing activities must be skilled and experienced for the purpose of this penetration test. The following certifications are an indication of skill and hsould be accompanied by years of experience in similar pentest projects:

* OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)  
* EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) 
* CREST Penetration Testing Certifications 
* Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications 
* Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) 

Penetration testers skills and experience must be documented in the penetration test report.

#	Test Setup

This chapter describes the specific setup for this penetration test.

##	Scoping

_TODO: the following chapter is highly depending on the actual system under test and this template can not give adequate text suggestions. Find below an example that needs larger rework by the document author._

The system under test is defined by the name and version on the title page of this document. Furthermore the detailed scope is equivalent to **the components found inside the "medical device" trust boundary** as described in the annex **System Architecture, chapter 3, Data Flow Diagram**, including all external interfaces and the interactions over that trust boundary. 

**Not in scope are the neighboring systems on the other side of these interactions. Also out-of-scope are the operating system and system tools underneath the software-as-medical-device, as the customer will be responsible for providing this part of the operating environment. Neighboring systems that use proprietary protocols can be provided for the pentest upon request.**

_TODO: The following suggestions may be applicable typically, still review to match it to your needs._

Out of scope are also all attacks that require social engineering of the users of the system under test.

Destructive testing of the provided hardware needs prior approval by the pentest client.

Testing of application components running in the cloud are subject to the "rules of engagement" for conducting penetration tests on the infrastructure of the cloud provider - see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement  

##	Research Goals

The pentest methodology describes the explorative approach and gives testers guidance on how to conduct the penetration test. Research goals are additional areas of interest, specific to the system under test, that shall be investigated during the penetration test. This is not to replace the general methodological approach.

_TODO: the following examples are intended to help understanding the idea behind research goals and give inspiration. As those are highly specific to the system under test, those must be replaced with actual goals. Those can be taken from a number of sources: the chapter "for future penetration tests" from previous penetration tests. Areas where architects or developers have a bad gut feeling about security, but cannot pin it down to actual vulnerabilities. Assumptions that were made during design and development that, if violated, would result in a vulnerable system._

**Password reset via SMS token: can the penetration testers obtain a new password for a valid user by exploiting the SMS token that is used during password reset without having access to the mobile phone receiving the SMS?** 

**Escaping kiosk mode: The medical device is a windows application running in kiosk mode. The Windows OS has been configured to prevent users with physical access to the GUI of the device. Can the penetration testers escape kiosk mode and interact with the Windows OS directly?**

**Scope change for vulnerabilities requiring physical access: With physical access and tools to open the device enclosure an attacker can access a serial console for debugging purposes. This is a known vulnerability where the risk has been accepted. Can penetration testers obtain information, such as credentials, via the serial console of one device to exploit ANOTHER device over a remote connections?**

##	Product Modifications

For the purpose of this penetration test, the system under test has been modified to allow easier and deeper access for penetration testers or prevent false negatives during testing. These modifications are not exiting or securely disabled during production. Vulnerabilities against these functionality must not be filed in the penetration test report. If the penetration testers suspect exploitability in one of these areas, an unmodified system under test can be provided. The modifications and consequent exclusion of functionality during the pentest shall be documented in the report. 

_TODO: the following are examples intended to serve as inspiration, but are greatly dependent on the specific system under test. Consider these if your penetration test would benefit from such modifications. If not, remove the examples or the entire chapter_

**SSH access for user 'root' with static password to allow for authenticated vulnerability scanning. This is not enabled on production settings**

**Serial console to observe the boot process and read log files. Cabling to the exterior of the device has been provided for the pentest and is not present on a production device**

**Log shipping has been enabled on the product to transfer the syslog unencrypted to IP address 192.168.0.99, UDP port 514. This functionality is disabled by default in a production environment**

#	Execution

The pentest provider is in charge of the creation of a project plan and its execution. 

The pentest provider will provide the following:

1. Contact details of the primary contact, including e-mail address and telephone number
1. Secure data storage - all data that is received or discovered as part of the penetration test project must be stored securely and never unencrypted on any system under the control of the provider. This includes backup as well as cloud-synchronized data.
1.  Emergency communication - in case of critical findings during the test or in case infrastructure outside of the system under test was harmed by penetration testing activities, the provider will inform the client immediately.
1. Penetration testing equipment, including devices, software & licenses, tooling, analysis equipment, backup

The client will provide the following:

1. Contact details of the primary contact, including e-mail address and telephone number
1. Location - a lab for the duration of the pentest with an isolated testing network as well as a guest WiFi to allow for internet access. Access badges will be provided to named penetration testers only, government ID is required.
1. Credentials - including usernames and passwords, tokens, keys, secrets needed to use the system under test under every role
1. Test data - all data that is needed to execute the happy-path of security-relevant use cases  
1. Secure data exchange - a place where client and provider can exchange files securely during the test - no confidential information shall be exchanged via e-mail!

_TODO: Move items between these two lists as needed, for example "Location", if the pentest is taking place at the providers location._

The penetration test project plan shall incorporate the following touch points:

## Kick-off meeting

Timing: Day 1, 3 hours

Prerequisites: Penetration testers have access to the system under test and have read the **"Developer Quickstart Guide" (depending on what was delivered to the provider upfront)**

Goal: to ensure penetration testers are able to interact with the system under test over all interfaces, can execute the “happy path” of use cases and all credentials are working. 

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Client Software Developer, Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers 

## Daily 

Timing: Every working day, 15 minutes

Goal: Summarize progress and next steps for today. Discuss any road-blocks encountered and have the client to support in their resolution. 
	
Participants: Client Security Engineer, Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers (all) 

## Technical deep dive 

Timing: whenever needed 

Goal: In case penetration testers have hit a road block or need support by software developers, e.g. by reviewing certain areas of the source code. 

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Client Software Developer (as needed), Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers (as needed) 

## Critical Findings  

Timing: whenever needed 

Goal: In case critical security findings were identified or out-of-scope systems are affected by the pentest, to discuss immediate steps

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Client Software Developer (as needed), Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers (as needed) 
 
## Report Preview 

Timing: When report draft is ready, 1 hour 

Goal: Ensure that all reporting requirements are met

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Provider Project Manager 

## Post-test debriefing 

Timing: After the penetration test is finished, 1 hour 

Goal: Final approval of all penetration test deliverables. Feedback (in both directions) and how to further improve. Outlook for re-test. Discussion of shift-left activities. 

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Provider Project Manager 

##	Re-Test

_TODO:Decide, if you need this. A re-test is not necessary for the goals of security and compliance. A re-test can however be helpful if you plan to share the pentest report with 3rd parties, such as regulatory authorities or customers. Decide for yourself, if a "clean" report is worth the time and money. On the commercial side, a re-test is often offered for a lump sum of 5-10% of the initial pentest costs. It is highly recommended to leave this chapter in, to keep the option open requesting a re-test later on._

The client can request a re-test by the penetration testing provider. They will then verify the remediation applied by the client after the initial test and document the results in an updated version of the reports. The re-test shall not include the explorative scanning activities of a full penetration test. The updated reports shall allow the client to document the successful efforts after treatment of the vulnerabilities and to have a "clean" pentest report that the client can potentially share with 3rd parties.

The re-test shall be an optional item in the offer and the client can decide up to 6 month after the delivery of the inital pentest reports, whether to request a re-test. A re-test of a re-test shall be possible under the penetration test offer as well, in case findings were not correctly addressed in the first remediation attempt.

For the re-test, the client will provide one of the following status for each finding of the initial report:
1. the client has remediated the finding in the updated version provided for the re-test
1. the client has a different risk rating for the finding; expressed via CVSS environmental score metrics alongside a rationale
1. the client has not yet remediated the finding, it shall be ignored in the re-test

The penetration testing provider shall verify all remediated findings in the updated version provided by the client and update the report, if remediation can be confirmed. The penetration testing provider shall check the different risk rating and update the report if they agree, otherwise mark the scoring of the finding as disputed and document both ratings in the report. Findings that have not been remediated will be ignored in the re-test and not receive any updates in the report. See chapter "reporting requirements", on how updates to the reports shall be applied.  

#	Reporting

The penetration testing provider shall create the following two reports to document the entirety of the penetration test. Reports shall be delivered as PDF file format. Focus on content instead of eye-candy aspects. Coloring can be used but must not be used to solely carry relevant information, in case of visually impaired audience or black/white printing. For example, instead of just marking an element red, also print "critical" next to it.

_TODO:If more than one product has been the subject of the test, request one set of pentest reports per product. Having multiple products in a single report may result in confusion when assigning findings to development teams, during regulatory submissions, or may cause a scope creep during an audit._

## Summary Report

The summary report is intended for an external target audience, such as regulatory authorities or customers. It may not contain detailed information about individual vulnerabilities. It may also not contain names or contact information about employees.

The summary report shall contain at least the following chapters:
1. Management Summary: on a single page list product name and version, timeframe/duration, efforts spent, a table with the number of findings per criticality. Do not list individual findings.
1. Pentest Provider: company information, skills and experience of penetration testers, declaration of independence from the development team of the system under test
1. Pentest Activities: the methodology chosen for this pentest, list of activities mapped to the phases of the methodology
1. White-box Testing: List of information that has been provided by the client (e.g. document name and key elements found)
1. Research goals: Very high level summary of each research goal, but remain vague. Example: a research goal of “Check if PIN code during password reset process can be brute-forced” could be summarized as “One aspect of user authentication” 
1. Annex: only, if needed. Generic information should be moved here - for example do not explain in the report main content how a CVSS score is calculated.

## Detailed Report

The detailed report is intended for the internal development team. This report shall include everything from the summary report. In addition to that, a list of all findings that were discovered during the pentest. Every finding shall be listed with all of the following information:

* Unique ID
* Title 
* Description 
* Component 
* Affected assets 
* STRIDE category
* Interface: physical & logical (e.g. TCP port) 
* Steps to reproduce, incl. commands, screenshots
* Mitigation suggestion 
* CVSS v3.1 base score & vector
* CVSS rationale for factors that are not immediately obvious

_Remove the following sentence, if the product is not a medical device_
The CVSS scoring shall follow the Rubric for Applying CVSS to Medical Devices – see https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/publication/rubric-applying-cvss-medical-devices. 

In addition to a printable file format, the list of findings shall be made available by the pentest provider in a machine-readable format, such as CSV. The intention is for the client to be able to import the findings in a vulnerability management solution. 

If the penetration testing provider has created scripts for the purpose if this penetration test, those shall be provided as separate source code files. Pasting the source code of the script into the PDF report is not encouraged.

__Determine if you want to require a more specific file format here; especially if certain formats can be directly imported into the specific vulnerability management solution you plan to use.__

The detailed report shall also give recommendations "for future penetration tests", when resources during the current test were not sufficient to fully explore areas where the penetration testers are suspecting vulnerabilities but were unable to prove their existence. 

Furthermore, the detailed report shall list the modifications for penetration testing that have been applied to the system under test. The pentester shall declare that those ares were excluded from the test because the modifications were enabled solely for the purpose of the test.  

## Update for re-test 

This chapter is only applicable after a re-test has been conducted - see chapter "Re-Test" under "Execution" to learn more. 

Changes to the penetration testing reports triggered by re-test shall be transparent by only adding information. It is not the intention of a re-test to hide any vulnerabilities found in the initial phase of the penetration test. Instead, the client's successful and timely treatment of those findings shall be documented by the pentest provider. With the pentest provider and not the client issuing an updated version of the reports, a certain level of quality assurance is safeguarded from the perspective of a 3rd party.

The updated penetration test reports shall have their version number increased. A paragraph shall indicate when and on what version of the system under test the re-test has been executed. The vulnerability summary table shall receive another column indicating the new numbers per severity level after remediation. Each finding that the penetration test provider could verify to be remediated shall receive a CVSS score "after remediation". If fully remediated set the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability to none. If only partially remediated, document the new CVSS score accordingly. In both cases a rationale shall be added.

# Post-test phase

This chapter describes the activities that need to be executed after the actual penetration test has been completed.

## Knowledge transfer

The penetration testing provider shall identify testing activities that have been conducted during the penetration test and could be executed in the future also directly by the client. These activities are typically automated scans, not so much manual exploration that requires in-depth pentesting knowledge. 

The knowledge transfer shall contain more than just a command line to be executed by the client. Often, the obstacle is not starting the tool but understanding the output of the tool and what to do with that. The client shall be enabled to incorporate those tools as new test into their own internal test suite with the intention to execute those independently and regularly as early as possible in the development process ("shift left"). 

If this activity will exceed 4 hours of efforts, it shall be listed as an optional line item in the offer.

## Secure Data Deletion

The penetration test provider shall securely delete all information discovered during the penetration test as well as all confidential information received from the client for the purpose of the test. This shall include backups of the data as well as cloud-synchronized copies. The deletion shall be executed proactively by the pentest provider after the final version of the report has been accepted by the client. The provider shall submit a confirmation of deletion of all data or if certain data elements could not be deleted, list those data elements and give a rationale as to why those could not be deleted. If the client intends to perform a re-test, the client can request the penetration test provider to extend the retention period to cover the re-test.

## Future Improvements

The penetration test provider and the client shall give feedback to each other regarding the pentest process as described by this statement of work. The intention is to further improve this process and capture the needs or pain-points of either parties. 

_TODO: Any feedback regarding the process as described in this document is highly appreciated by the original author of this template. Feel free to create a issue under https://github.com/brahmstaedt/pentest/ or even suggest a change and raise a pull request. Or just send a quick thanks via a star-rating in Github, if you are just a happy user of this template._
