Penetration Test - Statement of Work

**product name and version**

__TODO: update all text in bold. Text in italics, like this, give hints to document authors and needs to be removed__

# Introduction

##	Goal
The objective of this penetration test is to uncover vulnerabilities in the assets of the system being examined, aiming to enhance the system's overall information security. Furthermore, this penetration test is mandatory to demonstrate compliance to internal and external secure software development lifecycle procedures. A comprehensive penetration test report will provide in-depth information on all discoveries, while a summarized report will present a condensed version suitable for sharing with third parties.

##	Approach
This statement-of-work document contains all information towards a potential penetration testing provider including 
1. documentation about the system under test
1. requirements towards the vendor and the penetration testers / ethical hackers
1. definitions of the target of the penetration test
1. the minimum activities required in the execution of the penetration test
1. requirements for the reporting of the penetration test
1. run-down and debriefing activities  

#	System under test

The following documentation is provided as annex to this statement of work document
1. end-user documentation - including configuration, operating environment requirements, users and roles
1. internal documentation - for example a "new developer quickstart guide" or anything to get pentesters started 
1. list of assets - including asset impact matrix by impediment
1. system architecture - including interfaces, data-flow diagrams, network protocols, SBOM
1. security assessment - threat model, cybersecurity risk management analysis

__TODO:Provide the above information with this SoW. If not available in existing documents or in case you do not want to share the entire document, add it as aub-chapter here, see example below__

## Asset impact matrix
The following matrix highlights protection requirements from a business perspective for each asset per impediment (confidentiality, integrity and availability):

| Asset                        | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Patient Health Information   | high            | high      | medium       |
| License information          | high            | medium    | medium       |
| Log files                    | none            | low       | low          |
| Intended Use (functionality) | n/a             | n/a       | critical     |

__TODO: Update that list to match the assets, change C/I/A values according to your business needs__

#	Provider Requirements

The following chapters describe requirements for the penetration testing provider, and its members of staff that directly participate in the penetration test of the system under test.

## Organization

The penetration testing provider must have proven experience in conducting penetration tests in the medical / healthcare industry.

The penetration testing provider and all of the penetration testers must not be involved in any activities related to the development or maintenance of the system under test other than penetration testing. 

The penetration testing provider agrees that the intellectual ownership of all documents created for this penetration test, including but not limited to the pentest report, is transferred to the client. The client may use these documents at their own discretion, including (but not limited to) sharing the documentation with regulatory authorities, customers, or providers for future penetration tests.

The penetration testing background of the organization as well as their independance must be documented in the report.

## Pentest Methodology

The penetration test must follow best practice from at least one of the major frameworks, such as  

* Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) 
* Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) 
* NIST Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (SP 800-115) 
* Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) 
* OWASP (Web / Mobile / Firmware) Testing Guide 
* BSI Praxis-Leitfaden für IS-Penetrationstests

The methodology of choice must fit the system under test and can be tailored. 

The pentest report must document, which methodology has been chosen by the pentest provider and why. The reporting structure should reflect the activities in the methodology as further evidence ot its adherence.

## Penetration Testers

The penetration test project members responsible for executing the actual testing activities must be skilled and experienced for the purpose of this penetration test. The following certifications are an indication of skill and hsould be accompanied by years of experience in similar pentest projects:

* OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)  
* EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) 
* CREST Penetration Testing Certifications 
* Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications 
* Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) 

Penetration testers skills and experience must be documented in the penetration test report.

#	Test Setup


#	Execution

The client will provide the following:

__Move items between these two lists as needed, for example "Location", if the pentest is taking place at the providers location.__

1. Contact Information of the primary contact, including e-mail address and telephone number
1. Location - a lab for the duration of the pentest with an isolated testing network as well as a guest WiFi to allow for internet access. Access badges will be provided to named penetration testers only, government ID is required.
1. Credentials - including usernames and passwords, tokens, keys needed to use the system under test under every role
1. Test Data - all data that is needed to execute the happy-path of security-relevant use cases  
1. Secure Data Exchange - a place where client and provider can exchange files securely during the test - no confidential information shall be sent via e-mail!

The pentest provider will provide the following:

1. Contact Information of the primary contact, including e-mail address and telephone number
1. Secure Data Storage - all data that is received or discovered as part of the penetration test project must be stored securely and never unencrypted. This includes backup or cloud-synchronized data.
1.  Emergency communication - in case of critical findings during the test or in case infrastructure outside of the system under test was harmed by penetration testing activities, the provider will inform the client immediately.
1. Penetration testing equipment, including devices, software & licenses, tooling

The pentest provider is in charge of the creation of a project plan and its execution. The plan shall incorporate the following touch points:

## Kick-off meeting

Timing: Day 1, 3 hours

Prerequisites: Penetration testers have received the system under test and have read the **"Developer Quickstart Guide" (depending on what was delivered to the provider upfront)**

Goal: to ensure penetration testers are able to interact with the system under test over all interfaces, can execute the “happy path” of use cases and all credentials are working. 
	
Participants: Client Security Engineer, Client Software Developer, Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers 

## Daily 

Timing: Every working day, 15 minutes

Goal: Summarize progress and next steps for today. Discuss road-blocks encountered. 
	
Participants: Client Security Engineer, Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers (all) 

## Technical deep dive 

Timing: whenever needed 

Goal: In case penetration testers have hit a road block or need support by software developers, e.g. by reviewing certain areas of the source code. 

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Client Software Developer (as needed), Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers (as needed) 

## Critical Findings  

Timing: whenever needed 

Goal: In case critical security findings were identified, to discuss immediate steps

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Client Software Developer (as needed), Provider Project Manager, Provider Ethical Hackers (as needed) 
 
## Report Preview 

Timing: When report draft is ready, 1 hour 

Goal: Ensure that all reporting requirements are met

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Provider Project Manager 

## Pentest Debrief 

Timing: After the penetration test is finished, 1 hour 

Goal: Final approval of all penetration test deliverables. Feedback (both directions) and how to further improve. Outlook for re-test. Discussion of shift-left activities. 

Participants: Client Security Engineer, Provider Project Manager
