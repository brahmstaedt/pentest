Penetration Test - Statement of Work

**product name and version**

__TODO: update all text in bold. Text in italics, like this, give hints to document authors and needs to be removed__

# Introduction

##	Goal
The objective of this penetration test is to uncover vulnerabilities in the assets of the system being examined, aiming to enhance the system's overall information security. Furthermore, this penetration test is mandatory to demonstrate compliance to internal and external secure software development lifecycle procedures. A comprehensive penetration test report will provide in-depth information on all discoveries, while a summarized report will present a condensed version suitable for sharing with third parties.

##	Approach
This statement-of-work document contains all information towards a potential penetration testing provider including 
1. documentation about the system under test
1. requirements towards the vendor and the penetration testers / ethical hackers
1. definitions of the target of the penetration test
1. the minimum activities required in the execution of the penetration test
1. requirements for the reporting of the penetration test
1. run-down and debriefing activities  

#	System under test

The following documentation is provided as annex to this statement of work document
1. end-user documentation - including configuration, operating environment requirements, users and roles
1. list of assets - including asset impact matrix by impediment
1. system architecture - including interfaces, data-flow diagrams, network protocols, SBOM
1. security assessment - threat model, cybersecurity risk management analysis

__TODO:Provide the above information with this SoW. If not available in existing documents or in case you do not want to share the entire document, add it as aub-chapter here, see example below__

## Asset impact matrix
The following matrix highlights protection requirements from a business perspective for each asset per impediment (confidentiality, integrity and availability):

| Asset                        | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Patient Health Information   | high            | high      | medium       |
| License information          | high            | medium    | medium       |
| Log files                    | none            | low       | low          |
| Intended Use (functionality) | n/a             | n/a       | critical     |

__TODO: Update that list to match the assets, change C/I/A values according to your business needs__

#	Provider Requirements

The following chapters describe requirements for the penetration testing provider, and its members of staff that directly participate in the penetration test of the system under test.

## Organization

The penetration testing provider must have proven experience in conducting penetration tests in the medical / healthcare industry.

The penetration testing provider and all of the penetration testers must not be involved in any activities related to the development or maintenance of the system under test other than penetration testing. 

The penetration testing provider agrees that the intellectual ownership of all documents created for this penetration test, including but not limited to the pentest report, is transferred to the client. The client may use these documents at their own discretion, including (but not limited to) sharing the documentation with regulatory authorities, customers, or providers for future penetration tests.

The penetration testing background of the organization as well as their independance must be documented in the report.

## Pentest Methodology

The penetration test must follow best practice from at least one of the major frameworks, such as  

* Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) 
* Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) 
* NIST Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (SP 800-115) 
* Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) 
* OWASP (Web / Mobile / Firmware) Testing Guide 
* BSI Praxis-Leitfaden f√ºr IS-Penetrationstests

The methodology of choice must fit the system under test and can be tailored. 

The pentest report must document, which methodology has been chosen by the pentest provider and why. The reporting structure should reflect the activities in the methodology as further evidence ot its adherence.

## Penetration Testers

The penetration test project members responsible for executing the actual testing activities must be skilled and experienced for the purpose of this penetration test. The following certifications are an indication of skill and hsould be accompanied by years of experience in similar pentest projects:

* OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)  
* EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) 
* CREST Penetration Testing Certifications 
* Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications 
* Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) 

Penetration testers skills and experience must be documented in the penetration test report.
