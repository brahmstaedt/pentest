Penetration Test - Statement of Work

**product name and version**

# Introduction

##	Goal
The objective of this penetration test is to uncover vulnerabilities in the assets of the system being examined, aiming to enhance the system's overall information security. Furthermore, this penetration test is mandatory to demonstrate compliance to internal and external secure software development lifecycle procedures. A comprehensive penetration test report will provide in-depth information on all discoveries, while a summarized report will present a condensed version suitable for sharing with third parties.

##	Approach
This statement-of-work document contains all information towards a potential penetration testing provider including 
1. documentation about the system under test
1. requirements towards the vendor and the penetration testers / ethical hackers
1. definitions of the target of the penetration test
1. the minimum activities required in the execution of the penetration test
1. requirements for the reporting of the penetration test
1. run-down and debriefing activities  

#	System under test

The following documentation is provided as annex to this statement of work document
1. end-user documentation - including configuration, operating environment, users and roles
1. list of assets - including asset impact matrix by impediment
1. system architecture - including interfaces, data-flow diagrams, network protocols, SBOM
1. security assessment - threat model, cybersecurity risk management analysis

__Provide the above information with this SoW. If not available in existing documents or in case you do not want to share the entire document, add it as aub-chapter here, see example below __

## Asset impact matrix
The following matrix highlights protection requirements from a business perspective for each asset per impediment (confidentiality, integrity and availability):

| Asset                        | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Patient Health Information   | high            | high      | medium       |
| License Information          | high            | medium    | medium       |
| Log filed                    | none            | low       | low          |
| Intended Use (functionality) | n/a             | n/a       | critical     |
